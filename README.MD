## Description

A learning project made for the Epicodus programming course to practice writing an Model-View-Controller web application with the .NET 5.0 framework.

This application will track the vendors that purchase baked goods from "Pierre's Bakery" and the orders belonging to those vendors.

For example, Pierre might supply croissants to a vendor called "Suzie's Cafe" once a week. Pierre may want to create a new Vendor to represent the cafe and add new Orders to it to help keep track of his expanding business relationships.
